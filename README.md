## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - For styles


### What I learned

I learned how to persist the selected theme (dark or light) using Reactâ€™s useState and useEffect, storing the value in localStorage.

```js

const [isDark, setIsDark] = useState(() => {
    const storedTheme = localStorage.getItem("theme");
    return storedTheme === "dark";
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isDark) {
      document.body.classList.add("dark");
      document.body.classList.remove("light");
      localStorage.setItem("theme", "dark");
    } else {
      document.body.classList.add("light");
      document.body.classList.remove("dark");
      localStorage.setItem("theme", "light");
    }
  }, [isDark]);

```


### Continued development

As I continue to refine my frontend development skills, here are some areas I want to improve in future projects:
- Improve theme management by using CSS variables and detecting system preferences.
- Enhance UI transitions, especially gradient effects and animations.
- Focus on accessibility, ensuring better ARIA support.
